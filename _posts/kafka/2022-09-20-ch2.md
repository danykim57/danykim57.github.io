Kafka tutorial

A record or a message is data that goes in and out from Kafka.

Kafka records are consist of key, value, and timestamp.

The records are stored in the unit of "Topic".

Topic is partitioned and replicated.

Topic is consist of partitions.

Each partition is an ordered, immutable, sequence of records.

Topic > Partition > record

By marking with an offset, consumer keeps how far it read.

Message brokers in Kafka act like servers.
